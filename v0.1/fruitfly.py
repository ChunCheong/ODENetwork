# This script illustrates some details about the architecture of the insect

# Please refer to networks.py for details of implmentation.
# Connectivities are known up to various levels of details;
# Numbers of neurons are well-known, connectivity beteen anatomical stucture
# are known, probabilities of random connections are less clear.
# Anyway, details may change as we dig deeper over time.

# Finally, the tunings of the recpetors are actually fairly sohpisticated, and

# Therefore, it might not be immediately useful for every ML task. For image
# classficiation purpose, some adapter/filter mimic recpetive field could be
# a good start. It seems Jon Larson and coworkers have figured it out already.
# Would love to hear more.
